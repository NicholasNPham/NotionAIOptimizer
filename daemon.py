# Notes
"""
Im thinking of running a daemon from an application created with Tkinter

This is created with Tkinter for now, then learn how to make an application on desktop that starts on startup
    create a "application
    create drop down menu with daemon and select
    display button run and quit
    when run, open command prompt and type a run command of daemon file that runs the main.py file to run on logging on
    we can first try at open however, I dont want to have the pc turn on in the early morning. so push for on log on.
