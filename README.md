Title: Python AI Schedule Optimizer

Goal: This project will create an app that will use AI to optimize my schedule created first hand and increase productivity and work flow. 

1. The data supplied from Notion is:
   2. Events, Tasks, and Priority Levels.
2. I will either create my own database or use a pre-existing database based on the Notion API or use SQl (Subject to Change).
3. I want this program to run first off of manual trigger once a day, then eventually
   4. Provide real time updates.
   5. AI will read websites based on given information and plan next day for me to evaluate and continue along.

Notes: 
1. To start this project I need to start off with a "work schedule" notion databas
   2. This will be done with Selenium or Playwrite to control the browser and securely login into my employee portal.
   3. Login info will be kept securely and either methods will control website access for me.
   4. This is going to be updated automatically on pc start up with Windows Task Scheduler
